# Machine_Learn_Project
A Repo for the main project for the machine learning course @UWindsor

<b>Problem</b>
<p>
  This project looks to identify patterns to the housng market in Canada, then use that to predict the pattern and cost over the next ten years (2024-2034).
</p>

<b>Our Approach</b>
<p>
   We used a random forest model with a random search hyperparameter. One of the most importaint things we did was use a scaler for the data during training of our model. The data set it taken from the MSI database focusing on the HPI and the average cost of different property types.
</p>

<b>Outcome</b>
<p>
  The outcome from this project shows a pattern of high markets in the spring and lowest markets in the early winter months.
